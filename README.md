# pomodoro-webapp

In-progress pomodoro timer that allows the user to choose features such as:
* Theme (soundtrack, color)
* Duration of the timer

What I learned to implement in the process:
* How to utilize setInterval and clearInterval
* DOM manipulation
* Modulus operator for time calculation
* Nested functions
* Set audio play
